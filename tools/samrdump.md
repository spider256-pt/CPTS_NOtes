'''samrdump.py is a script from the Impacket toolkit that allows enumeration of domain users, groups, and policy info via the SAMR (Security Account Manager Remote) protocol over SMB.
It works even with anonymous access, and is often used for RID cycling or gathering user information from misconfigured servers.'''
